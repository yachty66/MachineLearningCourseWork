    "In this notebook you performed convolution operations on small example images by hand. It can be very helpful to walk through operations like im2col or vectorization by hand so you gain an intuition about how it works under the hood. Another benefit is that in the next notebook you're going to implement convolution as algorithms - You'll use the small toy examples to verify if your algorithms are working correctly."
